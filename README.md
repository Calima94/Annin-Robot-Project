This was my first Arduino program and my first python application using the Tk module.
I hope people will enjoy building thier own robot, utilize and improve the software
and design and build bigger and better robot units and share thier designs.

1. review the bill of materials
2. review the assembly instructions
3. download models and build robot
4. review calibration video [Calibration Video](https://youtu.be/jC1Iq60EnBI)
5. review programming video [Programming Video](https://youtu.be/hFJe0j0nB_w)
